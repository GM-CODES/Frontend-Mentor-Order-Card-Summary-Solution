## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- CSS media query for mobile responsiveness

### What I learned

I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of CSS flexbox. The challenge also provided an avenue for practical application of my knowledge of media query for resposivess.

### Continued development

I still belief I need to learn and apply media query more. I also intends to proceed and learn CSS Grid and combine the knowledge with flexbox with more practical applications.
